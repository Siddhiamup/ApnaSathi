								Started in 2002, Apna Sathi is an Indian development organisation that works with
								children and their families to
								provide access to quality education, primary healthcare and livelihood opportunities. We
								have over 130 projects,
								spread over 2000 villages and slums in 25 states of the country.
								Apna Sathi Foundation acts as a catalyst in the cycle of change, complementing and
								supplementing government
								efforts towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We collaborate,
								sensitize and partner with
								like-minded institutions and individuals to implement high-impact programmes. The focus
								is to enable access,
								enhance quality and bring long-term behavioral change to communities, especially at the
								grassroots.
								<br><br>When you make a donation under Section 80G to Apna Sathi Foundation, you can
								claim a tax deduction on the
								donated amount. This reduces your overall taxable income, and you end up paying less in
								income tax. We are
								registered under Section 12A (a) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the Indian Trusts Act,
								1882.
